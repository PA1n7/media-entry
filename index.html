                    <p>Radiohead poster redesign.</p>
                    <a class="showmore"><p class="more">
                        This radiohead poster redesign was based on the swissted poster which you can find by <label id="https://www.swissted.com/products/radiohead-at-the-warfield-1997">clicking here</label>. I used the original color palette, and I used the lines in the original one as to create the effect of soundwaves, on top of that, I added the details of the concert on the soundwaves. This was done last year during quarantine.

                    <p>Design for a made up christmas company.</p>
                    <a class="showmore"><p class="more">
                        The december before 2020, we had to create a sort of local bussiness selling jars. OSHO was not my idea, it wasn't even the one I created, so instead of a design it is more like a redesign for the original logo, due to the original having a "canva" watermark. I used illustrator for the new logo, I was pretty new to the program at the time, but now I have become better, not saying it's bad or anything. This was done last year during quarantine.

                        The album named "fantasmas" by Willie Colon is great in very many levels, only thing is the cover. The original cover you can find by <label id="https://www.cesarmiguelrondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Willie_Colon-Fantasmas.jpg">clicking here</label> the one that is being used by spotify and many other music streaming services is <label id="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QCauMzGUNGA/YBHenfyMYxI/AAAAAAAALzs/UCqk2TARXA8WCCo4E6B7-rT2DwlIQ5xnwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Fantasmas%2B-%2BAlbum-600-cover.jpg">this one</label>. I redesigned it using adobe illustrator, for a color palette I used magic man from adventure time, the actual vynil cover can be found by <label id=".\picture.html?img=fantasmas-cover.png">clicking here</label> this was done the 18th of november, 2021 :/

                    <a class="showmore"><p class="more">
                        It really is just a sketch I made in my notebook, also wanted to test the blur effect in illustrator, also a reason for which I use illustrator is because it will automatically make your lines not be so bad looking, or at least it fixes them a bit, the background is colored beige because it is just a color I associate to coffee constantly without thinking, the page where it was sketched does not have a date on it, so 2021 I guess.

                        I mean there isn't much to explain about this caveman, he is gentle, he was mainly made because I was bored, there isn't much to explain about it.

                        This bird even though it is 3D was made using illustrator. At first I created a simple bird svg with illustrator and I imported the svg to blender, then I created sort of a studio inside it, then changed the material of the svg to glass, added a light, and using cycles I rendered it to look like this.

                    <p class="">When creating the poster for the ACNUR comitee I used illustrator, and I used the league spartan for the sticker that would appear on top of the eyes of the stitched pictures, then below I wrote a text with the courier font as if written by a typewriter. I used a white text to signify light and I used a darker version of the MUN blue.</p>
