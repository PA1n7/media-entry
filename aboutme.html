                    Hey! I'm Sebastian Merchan, and I am here to help you with digital creation of art and videos with the programs adobe illustrator, adobe after effects and blender, while, of course, being able to edit images on the side with photoshop, or editing videos with adobe premiere pro.

                <h2>My speciality</h2>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 15px;"><p>
                    If ever in need of creating a virtual animation or illustration I am great for a job like that, I am good with colors and choosing color palettes for my works. I am good for creating simple designs that are helpful for conveying a message to a user. Usually I work with images, but recently I started creating videos like the one below.

                <h2>Why did I apply?</h2>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><p class="">
                    I decided to apply for the Media club because I think it would help me learn a lot, not only being there but even after, creating this webpage from scratch and creating the designs were a great learning experience, and I believe that in the club I might be able to get these learning experiences. I mean, at the beggining I didn't know if I should, I was considering the odds of getting in, and the time I would need, but then I just decided to put my name on the list, I still didn't know what to do or what to show, then I just decided to do what I like to do and it's simple aesthetic designs, like the webpage.
