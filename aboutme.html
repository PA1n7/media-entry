                    I am here to help you with your digital needs, I am good using the pack of Adobe applications like photoshop, premiere, illustrator, between others. I am also useful when it comes to learning other applications, like blender for 3D designs, or even html for webpage design, a good example of that is this webpage, I coded it from scratch, so I hope you like it :D

                <h2>What I do</h2>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 15px;"><p>If you ever are in need of a digital design with a simple look, I am good at that, using illustrator I am able to create designs that convey a message, using the colors you want. If you need a 3D design I am able to use blender. Even if you need animations, I'm your guy, I am good with after effects. An example of this is the video below.

                    I am not really much for trying to join something like this, I mean, I made the page two days ago, not because I was lazy,
                    but because I didn't even have an idea of what I wanted to do until just recently, so when I put my name on the list, it
                    was just that. Just creating the portafolio was a learning experience using html, css and javascript, or using after effects to create an
                    animation. That is what I expect media to be, a learning experience, a place where I will be able to further develop my current
                    creative abilities.
